# Hudson Bakery: Forecasting Pipeline🍞📊

A **Streamlit application** for bakeries to predict next week’s baking quantities in real time.  
Built for Hudson’s Bakery (Bondi Junction) as part of a capstone project.

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload & Normalize Sales**: Upload CSV/XLSX exports (Square “wide” or tidy format).
- **Automatic Enrichment**: Weather and public holiday data pulled and merged.
- **Forecast Generation**: Predict next week’s baking quantities (Mon–Sat).
- **Export**: Save forecasts to Excel; automatic archiving of past runs.
- **Email Option**: (Configurable) send forecasts via email.
- **History Browsing**: View previous forecasts and database backups.
- **User Management**: Login with roles (admin/user), create users, OTP-based password reset.
- **Model Retraining**: Improve accuracy by retraining item-level models.

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Create the first admin user** (only once):
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/ui_app.py
   ```

3. **Login** with your admin account.

4. **Workflow**:
   - Upload sales CSV/XLSX.
   - Load/refresh weather and holidays.
   - Generate forecast (Mon–Sat).
   - Export to Excel (auto-saved in `outputs/`).
   - (Optional) Email the forecast.

## 📊 Models & Forecasting

- Each item gets its own **ridge regression model**.
- Features used:
  - Day of week (Mon–Sat)
  - Weather (temperature, rain)
  - Public holidays & manual events
- Models are stored in the SQLite DB.
- Retrain via:
  - Admin → “Improve accuracy”
  - or CLI:  
    ```bash
    python train_models.py
    ```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Passwords hashed with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 + per-user salt.
- Supports OTP-style password reset.
- **Secrets (SMTP, DB paths, etc.)** should be kept in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and **never committed** to Git.
